Development History for Project FlowerPI (see: https://github.com/astaubert/flowerpi)
=====================================================================================

24.09.15 [air]		Created first python program!!!

		Used the following resource in order to do my first experiments from python to Rails
				
		http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html
				
04.10.15 [air]		First version of flowerpi.py is ready!!!! Works great :-))

		Function: 
				
		- will query for a flower based on TAG number
		- if flower does not exist, it will create a DUMMY flower for the new tag
				
	
20.10.15 [pi]		Created GIT public repository (see github.com)

		echo "# flowerpi" >> README.md
		git init
		git add README.md
		git commit -m "first commit"
		git remote add origin https://github.com/astaubert/flowerpi.git
		git push -u origin master

		username: astaubert
		passwort: gi______5
		
23.10.15 [air]		Cloned repository also on MacBook Air

		Andreass-MBAir:PythonDev admin$ git clone https://github.com/astaubert/flowerpi
		Cloning into 'flowerpi'...
		remote: Counting objects: 7, done.

		Checking connectivity... done.
		Andreass-MBAir:PythonDev admin$ ls
		
		see git documentation how to treat clones: https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/
		
27.10.15 [air]		Merged POST-Test (see 24.09. & 04.10) python programs with GPIO test program

		Created "Main" and "Import" structure based on recommendation in:
		http://intermediate-and-advanced-software-carpentry.readthedocs.org/en/latest/structuring-python.html
				
		Main Program is: floperpi-main.py
				
		Created my first library "fplog.py" which provides a generic logging function: 
				
		def l(value, test="no")
				
		Which logs the "value" to the console, as well as to different file, depending whether the function is
		executed as part of a library, or as part of a script!
		
		Created library "fppost.py", which implements the communication with the rails DB as a test ... so far
		
29.10.15 [pi]		Pulled data from repository into PI - works great! (see https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote)

pi@raspberrypi ~/flowerpi $ 

		Created library "fpflow.py", which implements the interface to the water-flow sensor via GPIO-IN
			
30.10.15		Continued to work on fpflow.py, create two functions: wfstart and wfcount

		Finished Test code in fpflow.py: waiting for water to flow (timeout 4 seconds), wait until water flow ends (output: counts)

		Worked on mechanical setup of "Gieskanne" with a wateflow sensor attached and a "Box" that could contain the electronics

		Added blue LED in fpflow.py to indicate system is waiting for water

		Working on fppost.py

		=> figured out the creating functions is not so helpful, since "requests" is used for most post functions anyway!

31.10.15		Created library "fprfid.py" based on "rfid_example.py" from D.J.Whale
		(see: http://blog.whaleygeek.co.uk/raspberry-pi-rfid-tag-reader)

		Changed GPIO setup in flowerpy.py to mode BCM, in order to comply with fprfid.py!

01.11.15		Created new function to query if site is online in fppost.py: def poquerysite(logtype="production")

		Worked on flowerpi-main.py on macbook

		Debug flowerpi-main.py on raspberry PI ... PHASE 1-3 WORK!!!

		PHASE4a also works: query if tag exists, if not create one.

		NEXT step to implement: ...	# Store new record in 'waters'

03.11.15	Implemented also green and red led to indicate success and failure in WEB communication ... WORKS!!!

21.11.15	Implemented support for new hardware-switch and LED to detect whether fertilizer was used or not

22.11.15	Debug new hardware-switch => works now

25.11.15	Managed to get remote access from mbair to Raspberry Pi via:

			Andreass-MBAir:~ admin$ ssh pi@raspberrypi
			pi@raspberrypi's password: pi.....e
			Linux raspberrypi 4.1.7-v7+ #817 SMP PREEMPT Sat Sep 19 15:32:00 BST 2015 armv7l

			the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the

			Last login: Wed Nov 25 22:55:55 2015 from andreass-mbair.fritz.box
			pi@raspberrypi ~ $
			
			Added .gitignore file that contains: flowerpi_test.log and flowerpi_prod.log
			
			===>>>>> cool: remote control from Macbook works !!!
			
			Tried to shutdown PI via command:
			
			pi@raspberrypi ~/flowerpi $ sudo shutdown -h now

			Broadcast message from root@raspberrypi (pts/0) (Wed Nov 25 23:28:26 2015):
			The system is going down for system halt NOW!
			pi@raspberrypi ~/flowerpi $ Connection to raspberrypi closed by remote host.
			Connection to raspberrypi closed.
			Andreass-MBAir:~ admin$
			
			===>>>>> cool: remote shutdown works as well !!!

26.11.15	Added WiFi-2 to wlan-configuration, based on: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md

29.11.15    Added code to upload new 'water record' to web application ===>> WORKS :-))

			Implemented LED color schema according to https://immense-cliffs-8170.herokuapp.com/piflowtable.html
			
			Implemented infinite loop in flowerpi-main.py
			
			===>> Works :-)), was able to demonstrate a couple of "waterings" after each other!
			
19.12.15	Renamed log-files to fp_prod.log and fp_test.log

28.12.15	Worked on fpflow.wfcount in order to increase count-values (Aufloesung) of watering-events

			Implemented script to restart WLAN if lost, based on:
			
			    http://weworkweplay.com/play/rebooting-the-raspberry-pi-when-it-loses-wireless-connection-wifi/
			
			Change IP address from DHCP to static - 192.168.178.37 (sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces), based on:
			
			    http://weworkweplay.com/play/automatically-connect-a-raspberry-pi-to-a-wifi-network/

29.12.15	Evaluated conversion factor from count to mL: 

			# overriding GLOBAL variable with local content; Division of factor 1.76 mL/counts, turns counts into mL

			global WATERCOUNT; WATERCOUNT = int(totalcount * 1.76)		
			
			==> Calibration of counts to water in mL ===>>> WORKS :-))) 
			
			Created version of FlowerPI V01.01.00
			
30.12.15	Tried to reduce crashes during "reading of the RF-ID"

			# RF-ID lesen
			global RFIDREAD; RFIDREAD = False

			while not(RFIDREAD):
				try:
					phase2readrfid()
				except Exception:
					fplog.l("Error: Exception during execution of phase2readrfid()")
					blinkredled()
			
			Was able to reproduce a problem once where the card was not read properly ===>>> Works:
			
			fplog 2015-12-30 16:29:05: Waiting for a card...
			fplog 2015-12-30 16:29:07: Card is present
			fplog 2015-12-30 16:29:07: Error: The scanned RF-id tag is not a mifare card
			fplog 2015-12-30 16:29:22: Error: Exception during execution of phase2readrfid()
			fplog 2015-12-30 16:29:24: PHASE2: wait for RF-ID tag

			Created version of FlowerPI V01.02.00

External libraries that need to be installed:

	1.) requests (see: http://docs.python-requests.org)


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Changes to Raspberry PI Linux environment:

28.12.15:   Implemented script in order to re-start WLAN in case it is lost, check every 2 minutes

			based on: http://weworkweplay.com/play/rebooting-the-raspberry-pi-when-it-loses-wireless-connection-wifi/
			
			(changed from 5 minutes to 2 minutes WLAN check)

GPIO-Belegung [BCM notation!]:

	in fpflow:

		# Set to the GPIO required to monitor the waterflow sensor (BCM notation!)
		GPIO_WATERFLOW_SENSOR = 22

		# Set to the GPIO required to activate the blue LED (BCM notation!)
		GPIO_BLUE_LED = 7

	in flowerpi-main.py:

       ... see sourcecode!
